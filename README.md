# NebraskaCode2025ContractTesting

This is the project used for my presentation for Nebraska.Code() 2025.

You can find the blog post with the slides here: [Nebraska Code 2025 â€“ How to Test Between Microservices Using Contract Testing](https://daninacan.com/nebraska-code-2025-how-to-test-between-microservices-using-contract-testing/). Please feel free to leave any questions and comments on that post.
